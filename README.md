# Supply Chain Analysis Project 📊📦

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of a supply chain network, focusing on financial performance, inventory management, manufacturing quality, and logistics optimization. By analyzing the end-to-end lifecycle, I identified key bottlenecks and strategic opportunities to enhance profitability and operational efficiency.

### 1. Executive Summary (Overview)
* [cite_start]**Financial Performance**: Successfully achieved total sales exceeding **$2M** with a net profit of **$578K**[cite: 15, 17].
* [cite_start]**Top Performer**: The **Skincare** category emerged as the most profitable segment, contributing **$242K**[cite: 21, 24].
* [cite_start]**Geographic Insights**: **Mumbai** recorded the highest regional profit at **$138K**[cite: 35, 37].
* [cite_start]**Critical Issue**: Identified a high defect rate in the **Haircare** category, which directly correlates with its lower sales performance[cite: 25, 46].
* [cite_start]**Strategic Partner**: **Maersk** was identified as the most profitable supplier, playing a pivotal role across the supply chain[cite: 53, 62].

### 2. Inventory & Suppliers Analysis
* [cite_start]**Capital Allocation**: Currently holding **10K units** in stock with a market value of **$485K**[cite: 69, 78].
* [cite_start]**Procurement Strategy**: Analyzing a new order of **5K units** costing **$251K**, requiring careful cash flow management[cite: 95, 101, 128, 129].
* [cite_start]**Inventory Gaps**: Observed that stock levels in warehouses often exceed store distribution, risking stockouts due to the **15.96-day average lead time**[cite: 18, 79, 80].
* **Supplier Benchmarking (Maersk)**:
    * [cite_start]Most frequent partner with **164 transactions**[cite: 102, 103].
    * [cite_start]Lowest defect rate at **1.8**[cite: 134, 172].
    * [cite_start]Highest production volume at **14K units**[cite: 158, 162].
    * [cite_start]Dominant supplier for the **Skincare** category[cite: 104, 125].

### 3. Manufacturing & Quality Control
* [cite_start]**Timeline Challenges**: Manufacturing takes **14.77 days** on average[cite: 174]. Combined with shipping times, this necessitates a robust **Safety Stock** strategy.
* [cite_start]**Quality Crisis**: The average defect rate is **2.28%** [cite: 197][cite_start], peaking in **Chennai** at **2.64%**[cite: 235, 238].
* [cite_start]**Risk Assessment**: **12K units** are classified as "High Risk" for defects[cite: 224, 225].
* [cite_start]**Quality Testing**: Out of the total units produced, only **13K units** passed quality inspection, while **19K units** failed[cite: 220, 223].
* **Supplier Performance**:
    * [cite_start]**Maersk**: Lowest manufacturing time and competitive pricing[cite: 215, 259].
    * [cite_start]**Intercos**: Recorded the highest failure rates in quality tests[cite: 214, 259].

### 4. Shipping & Logistics
* [cite_start]**Carrier Efficiency**: **Maersk** is the most utilized carrier, despite higher costs due to volume[cite: 286, 316, 322].
* [cite_start]**Lead Time Comparison**: **DHL** offers the best lead time at **14.96 days** [cite: 279][cite_start], whereas **FedEX** averages **17 days**[cite: 306].
* [cite_start]**Transportation Modes**: **Rail** is the most frequently used mode with **184 orders** [cite: 324][cite_start], while **Road & Air** combinations are highly active[cite: 340, 341, 343].

## Conclusion & Recommendations
* **Supplier Optimization**: Increase dependency on **Maersk** for quality-critical components and reconsider the partnership with **Intercos** due to high failure rates.
* **Quality Intervention**: Implement immediate oversight in **Chennai** manufacturing facilities to investigate the high defect rates.
* **Inventory Velocity**: Optimize the distribution from warehouses to retail locations to reduce "dead capital" and improve product availability.
